Music has been known to have a relaxing effect on people and has been studied for its effect on sleep, but with contradicting results. This study uses an N-of-1 trial to assess the effect of listening to classical music before bed and after waking on sleep quality and morning mood. Data on sleep and mood are collected through daily use of a Fitbit and surveys the participant fills out each day. In an ABAB trial design, we find that classical music has no statistically significant effect on sleep quality or morning mood (p=0.06).
