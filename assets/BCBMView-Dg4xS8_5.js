In advanced cases of breast cancer, there is a higher risk of brain metastases (BCBM), the primary cause of death from breast cancer. As there is no cure for metastatic breast cancer, it is important to learn more about these severe cases and gain insight into the key factors influencing the progression of cancer, the treatment response, and the overall patient outcome. Since knowing the molecular subtype is essential for treatment strategy and subtype is typically determined through invasive biopsy, it is important to derive a way to predict the subtype through a non-invasive procedure.

In the third phase, we fused the best traditional model and the best CNN to create an ensemble classifier which had greater performance than the two models individually.
