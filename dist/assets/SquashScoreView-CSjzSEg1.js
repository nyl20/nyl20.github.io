Once a user signs in, they can add players and start a match. A match is recorded through user input of the last shot of each rally, while the match is being played in real time. The user can input details about each decisive shot like the specific shot taken, the direction, and the location. Multiple games can be played per match, with intermediate skill analysis for coaches to use during the 90 seconds allotted between games to coach during a match. A more in depth analysis is provided at the end of matches, as well as on a player's profile. Users can also search up previous matches they recorded and look at head-to-head analysis, which combines data across different matches.
