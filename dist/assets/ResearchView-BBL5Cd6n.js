Patients carry the tracker with them and press the button when they experience stress.",contribution:"Working with Dr. Jakob Eg Larsen, I contributed to the One Button Tracker project by building upon an extensive set of pre-existing code to create multiple graphical interfaces that may be used for physicians to display the results of the One Button Tracker to their patients. I adapted my skills in JavaScript to work in Observable Notebooks and produced four unique interfaces, including heat maps, histograms, and scatter plots with varying ranges."},{status:"BirdCast",date:"Jun 2022 - Dec 2022",location:"Ithaca, NY",image:y,description:"The BirdCast project uses machine learning to document and classify birds and uses information gained to learn more about bird migration.
